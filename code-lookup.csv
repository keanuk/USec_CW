consent;;" Purpose  The purpose of this research project is to learn how computer science students interact with security topics in their studies and daily lives. The results of this research will help educators better understand the starting knowledge and needs of incoming students, not just security students. It will also help us better understand potential sources of attitudes and behaviours observed in professional software developers.  What will I be asked to do?  This survey will take approximately 25 minutes to complete. It will ask you multiple choice questions about different security-related concepts such as your attitudes towards security technologies as well as your awareness of different tools, technologies, and concepts. It will also ask you basic demographic information such as your age and education. Personally identifying information will not be collected.  Voluntary   Your participation in this survey is purely voluntary. At the end of the survey you will be asked to allow us to use your data for education and research purposes. You will have the option of selecting 'no' at that point and if you do so we will not share your survey answers as requested. If you select 'no' to both questions we will delete your data.  How will my data be used?   Your data will be used for two purposes. First, to provide data for the Usable Privacy and Security course so they can learn about survey design and analysis. If you consent to this, the information you provide in the survey will be given to the course students. Second, If you consent to this, we will use your data for research about how students understand and manage security concepts both as end-users and as future software developers.  Compensation  You will receive no compensation for completing this survey other than the knowledge you have benefited the Usable Security and Privacy course students and society more broadly. All participation is anonymous and we have no way of connecting responses to individual survey participants, therefore no compensation through credits or other means is possible.  Who is running the research?  This is a research project being conducted by Dr. Kami Vaniea and Mohammad Tahaei at the University of Edinburgh. If you have any questions about the research study, please contact Dr. Kami Vaniea at kami.vaniea@ed.ac.uk or Mohammad Tahaei at mohammad.tahaei@ed.ac.uk. If you have any concerns about your treatment or right as a research subject, you may contact the School Ethics Panel by e-mail to infkm+ethics@inf.ed.ac.uk. This research complies with the Informatics School ethics procedures for research involving human subjects. Clicking on the """"agree"""" button below indicates that:   you have read the above information 	you voluntarily agree to participate 	you are at least 18 years of age  	you are a student at the University of Edinburgh If you do not wish to participate in the research study, please decline participation by clicking on the """"disagree"""" button or leaving the page.";
